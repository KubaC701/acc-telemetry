# Performance Logging Feature

## Overview
Added comprehensive performance tracking to `main.py` to monitor the execution time of each processing step. This helps identify bottlenecks and optimize the video processing pipeline.

## What's Measured

### Per-Frame Operations (tracked every frame):
1. **Telemetry Extraction** - Throttle, brake, steering bar analysis
2. **Lap Number Detection** - Template matching for lap display
3. **Speed Extraction** - OCR for speed value
4. **Gear Extraction** - OCR for current gear
5. **Lap Transition Detection** - Logic to detect lap changes
6. **Lap Time Extraction** - OCR for lap times (only on transition frames)
7. **Data Storage** - Appending data to Python list
8. **Frame Processing** - Total time per frame (sum of all above)

### Output Generation:
- DataFrame creation
- CSV export
- Interactive HTML graph generation

### Overall:
- Total execution time (wall clock)

## Performance Report Format

The tool now outputs a detailed performance breakdown:

   Per-frame average: 15.08ms

   Actual FPS: 66.33
```

## Key Metrics Explained

### Average Time per Frame
- Shows typical processing time for one frame
- Lower is better
- Compare against video FPS to determine if real-time processing is possible

### Min/Max Times
- **Min**: Fastest frame processed (best case)
- **Max**: Slowest frame processed (worst case, often when OCR operations occur)
- Large variance indicates inconsistent performance

### Percentage of Total
- Shows which operation takes most time
- Helps prioritize optimization efforts
- Example: If "Speed Extraction" is 40%, optimizing OCR will have biggest impact

### Actual FPS
- Processing speed in frames per second
- If Actual FPS > Video FPS (30): Can process in real-time
- If Actual FPS < Video FPS: Processing takes longer than video playback

## Output Generation Summary
```
Output Generation Summary:
   DataFrame creation: 125.3ms
   CSV export: 45.2ms
   Graph generation: 2.34s
   Total: 2.51s
```

Shows time spent creating outputs after video processing is complete.

## Total Execution Time
```
⏱️  Total Execution Time: 47.74s (0.8 minutes)
```

Wall-clock time from start to finish, including initialization and cleanup.

## Usage

Performance logging is **always enabled** - no configuration needed. Just run:

```bash
python main.py
```

The performance report automatically appears after video processing completes.

## Interpreting Results

### Good Performance Indicators:
- ✅ Frame processing < 33ms average (can process 30 FPS video in real-time)
- ✅ Low variance between min/max times (consistent performance)
- ✅ Telemetry extraction < 30% of total time (efficient CV operations)
- ✅ Data storage < 5% of total time (minimal overhead)

### Performance Issues:
- ⚠️ Speed/Gear extraction > 50% of total time (OCR bottleneck)
- ⚠️ Max time >> Avg time (occasional slowdowns, likely OCR warmup)
- ⚠️ Actual FPS < 10 (very slow processing)

### Optimization Targets:
1. **If OCR is slow**: Consider caching, template matching instead of OCR
2. **If telemetry extraction is slow**: Review HSV color detection, optimize ROI sizes
3. **If frame processing overhead is high**: Optimize video reading, reduce copies

## Example Analysis

From typical run:
```
Speed Extraction: 5.22ms avg, 34.6% of total
Telemetry Extraction: 4.11ms avg, 27.3% of total
```

**Interpretation**: OCR operations (speed) take more time than computer vision (telemetry bars). This is expected since OCR is more complex than color detection. Template matching for lap numbers (2.85ms) is much faster than OCR.

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions:
- [ ] JSON export of performance data for analysis
- [ ] Performance comparison between runs
- [ ] Real-time performance dashboard during processing
- [ ] Automatic bottleneck detection with suggestions
- [ ] Per-operation breakdown (e.g., HSV conversion, masking, median calculation)
