### Bug Fix Documents (Historical)

Detailed technical analyses of bugs that were discovered and fixed. Information incorporated into TROUBLESHOOTING.md.

- **[LAP_DETECTION_BUG_FIX.md](LAP_DETECTION_BUG_FIX.md)** - Lap oscillation bug (Oct 2024, FIXED)
  - Technical analysis of 10↔11, 20↔21 oscillations
  - Root cause analysis
  - Solution implementation

### Deprecated Features

- **[KALMAN_FILTERING.md](KALMAN_FILTERING.md)** - Kalman filtering implementation (DEPRECATED)
  - ⚠️ **Status**: Implemented, tested, then replaced with simpler approach

## Documentation Philosophy

This documentation follows these principles:

1. **Preserve the Journey** - We document what was tried, what worked, what didn't, and why
2. **Explain the Why** - Not just how to use features, but why they exist and why certain approaches were chosen
3. **Historical Context** - Deprecated features and bug fixes are preserved as learning artifacts
4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Start with user guides, dive deeper into technical docs as needed
5. **Practical Focus** - Real-world examples and workflows, not just API documentation

## Contributing to Documentation

When updating documentation:

1. **Don't delete historical information** - Mark as deprecated/historical instead
2. **Explain the evolution** - Show what was tried and why decisions were made
3. **Update the index** - Keep this README.md current
4. **Cross-reference** - Link related documents together
5. **Preserve context** - Future developers benefit from understanding the journey

## Changelog

**January 2025** - Documentation reorganization
- Created consolidated core docs (USER_GUIDE, FEATURES, TROUBLESHOOTING, ARCHITECTURE)
