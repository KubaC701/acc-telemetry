# Track Position Tracking Feature

## Overview

Track position tracking has been successfully implemented! This feature extracts the car's position along the track from the minimap, enabling distance-based lap comparison and analysis.

**Key capability**: Track position is now exported as a percentage (0-100%) in the CSV output, representing how far through the lap the car has progressed.

## How It Works

### 1. **Track Path Extraction** (One-time, at startup)

The system extracts the white racing line from the minimap using a multi-frame approach:

- **Multi-frame sampling**: Samples frames 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 to avoid red dot occlusion
- **Color detection**: Uses HSV color masking to detect white pixels (racing line)
- **Path combination**: Combines masks from all frames to get complete path without gaps
- **Contour extraction**: Finds the largest contour (the racing line)
- **Arc length calculation**: Measures total path length for position calculation

**Why multi-frame?** The red dot sits on the start/finish line in frame 0, potentially hiding the white path underneath. By sampling multiple frames, the red dot is in different positions, ensuring complete path capture.

### 2. **Red Dot Detection** (Every frame)

Tracks the car's current position on the minimap:

- **HSV color masking**: Detects red pixels using two HSV ranges (red wraps around at 0/180)
- **Centroid calculation**: Uses cv2.moments() to find the center of the red dot
- **Fallback**: Returns last known position if red dot not detected (handles dropped frames)

### 3. **Position Calculation** (Every frame)

Converts red dot position to track position percentage:

- **Closest point search**: Finds nearest point on racing line to red dot
- **Arc length measurement**: Sums segment distances from path start to closest point
- **Percentage conversion**: `position = (arc_length / total_length) * 100`
- **Range clamping**: Ensures value stays within 0-100%

## Configuration

### ROI Setup

The minimap ROI has been added to `config/roi_config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Track map - circular minimap in top-left corner
track_map:
  x: 3
  y: 215
  width: 269
  height: 183
```

**Note**: These coordinates are for 1280×720 videos. Scale proportionally for other resolutions.

## CSV Output Format

The telemetry CSV now includes a `track_position` column:

```csv
frame,time,lap_number,lap_time,track_position,speed,gear,throttle,brake,steering,tc_active,abs_active
0,0.000,1,,0.0,0,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0
30,1.000,1,,12.5,145,3,85.2,0.0,0.15,0,0
60,2.000,1,,25.3,198,4,100.0,0.0,0.08,0,0
...
```

**Track position interpretation**:
- `0.0%` = Start/finish line
- `50.0%` = Halfway through lap
- `100.0%` = End of lap (approaching start/finish)
- Position naturally wraps around (100% → 0%) when crossing start/finish

## Integration Points

### Files Modified

1. **`config/roi_config.yaml`**
   - Added `track_map` ROI configuration

2. **`src/position_tracker.py`** (NEW)
   - `PositionTracker` class implementing path-following algorithm
   - `extract_track_path()`: Extract white racing line from multiple frames

   - `calculate_position()`: Convert dot position to track percentage
   - `extract_position()`: Main method called each frame
   - `reset_for_new_lap()`: Reset tracking on lap transition

3. **`src/video_processor.py`**
   - Updated `process_frames()` to extract and yield `track_map` ROI
   - ROI dictionary now includes: `throttle`, `brake`, `steering`, `track_map`

4. **`main.py`**
   - Import `PositionTracker`
   - Initialize position tracker
   - Extract track path from sampled frames at startup
   - Call `position_tracker.extract_position()` each frame
   - Call `position_tracker.reset_for_new_lap()` on lap transitions
   - Add `track_position` to telemetry data entries
   - Track position extraction in performance statistics

5. **`src/interactive_visualizer.py`**
   - Track position automatically included in DataFrame (no changes needed)
   - Track position automatically exported to CSV (no changes needed)
   - Added track position statistics to summary output

## Testing & Debugging

### Test Script

Run `test_position_tracking.py` to validate the implementation:

```bash
python test_position_tracking.py
```

**What it does**:
1. Extracts track path from minimap
2. Tests red dot detection on sample frames
3. Calculates position percentages
4. Creates debug visualizations in `debug/position_tracking/`

**Debug outputs**:
- `map_sample_frameXXXX.png`: Raw minimap samples
- `extracted_path.png`: Visualized white racing line
- `position_frameXXXX.png`: Position tracking with red dot overlay

### Validation Checklist

✅ **Track path extraction succeeds** (check console output)
✅ **Path contains 200+ points** (depends on track, but should be substantial)
✅ **Red dot detected in most frames** (occasional misses are OK)
✅ **Position progresses 0→100%** during a lap (check CSV)
✅ **Position resets to ~0%** when lap number increments
✅ **No large jumps** in position between consecutive frames

## Performance Impact

Position tracking adds minimal overhead:

- **Path extraction**: One-time cost at startup (~0.1-0.2s)
- **Per-frame cost**: ~0.5-1ms (HSV conversion + contour detection + closest point search)
- **Memory**: Negligible (path stored as list of tuples)

Performance is tracked in the main processing loop under `position_tracking`.

## Use Cases

### 1. Distance-Based Lap Comparison

Compare telemetry at the same track position across different laps:

```python
# Example: Compare throttle application at 25% through the lap
lap1_data = df[(df['lap_number'] == 1) & (df['track_position'] >= 24.5) & (df['track_position'] <= 25.5)]
lap2_data = df[(df['lap_number'] == 2) & (df['track_position'] >= 24.5) & (df['track_position'] <= 25.5)]

print(f"Lap 1 avg throttle at 25%: {lap1_data['throttle'].mean():.1f}%")
print(f"Lap 2 avg throttle at 25%: {lap2_data['throttle'].mean():.1f}%")
```

### 2. Sector Analysis

Divide track into sectors and analyze performance:

```python
# Define sectors (example: 3 equal sectors)
sector1 = df[df['track_position'] < 33.3]
sector2 = df[(df['track_position'] >= 33.3) & (df['track_position'] < 66.6)]
sector3 = df[df['track_position'] >= 66.6]

print(f"Sector 1 avg speed: {sector1['speed'].mean():.1f} km/h")
print(f"Sector 2 avg speed: {sector2['speed'].mean():.1f} km/h")
print(f"Sector 3 avg speed: {sector3['speed'].mean():.1f} km/h")
```

### 3. Track Position Graph

Plot telemetry against track position instead of time:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(df['track_position'], df['throttle'], label='Throttle', color='green')
plt.plot(df['track_position'], df['brake'], label='Brake', color='red')
plt.xlabel('Track Position (%)')
plt.ylabel('Input (%)')
plt.title('Throttle/Brake vs Track Position')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.savefig('position_vs_input.png')
```

## Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **Track-dependent path**: Path extraction happens once at startup
   - Solution: Re-extract path when track changes (requires track detection)

2. **No distance in meters**: Position is percentage, not actual distance
   - Solution: Add track length database to convert % to meters

3. **Simple closest-point matching**: Assumes red dot stays near path
   - Solution: Add velocity-based prediction for smoother tracking

4. **Resolution-dependent ROI**: Minimap coordinates hardcoded for 720p
   - Solution: Auto-detect minimap location or scale ROI dynamically

### Planned Enhancements

- **Track map overlay**: Visualize telemetry on 2D track layout
- **Corner detection**: Automatically detect corner entry/apex/exit points
- **Multi-lap heatmap**: Show speed/brake/throttle heatmap on track map
- **Position-based lap alignment**: Align laps by position for direct comparison

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Position always returns 0.0

**Cause**: Track path extraction failed

**Solution**:
1. Run `test_position_tracking.py` to check path extraction
2. Verify `track_map` ROI captures the minimap correctly
3. Check if white racing line is visible in `map_sample_frameXXXX.png` images
4. Adjust HSV color ranges in `PositionTracker` if needed

### Problem: Position jumps erratically

**Cause**: Red dot detection is unreliable or path is incomplete

**Solution**:
1. Check `position_frameXXXX.png` debug images - is red dot detected correctly?
2. Verify extracted path covers the full track (check `extracted_path.png`)
3. Sample more frames for path extraction (increase sample_frames list in main.py)

### Problem: Position doesn't reset at lap transitions

**Cause**: Position naturally wraps around - this is expected behavior

**Explanation**: Position algorithm handles wraparound automatically. When car crosses start/finish (lap transition), position goes from ~100% to ~0% naturally. The `reset_for_new_lap()` method exists for reference but doesn't need to do anything.

## Technical Details

### Color Ranges (HSV)

**White racing line**:
```python
white_lower = [0, 0, 200]    # Low saturation, high value
white_upper = [180, 30, 255]
```

**Red dot** (two ranges because red wraps around HSV):
```python
red_lower1 = [0, 120, 120]     # Red near 0°
red_upper1 = [10, 255, 255]

red_lower2 = [170, 120, 120]   # Red near 180°
red_upper2 = [180, 255, 255]
```

### Path-Following Algorithm

1. **Extract path** (startup):
   ```
   For each sampled frame:
     - Convert to HSV
     - Threshold white pixels
     - Combine masks with bitwise OR
   Find largest contour → racing line
   Calculate total arc length
   ```

2. **Track position** (each frame):
   ```
   Detect red dot → (dot_x, dot_y)
   Find closest path point to red dot
   Measure arc length from path start to closest point
   Position % = (arc_length / total_length) * 100
   ```

## Summary
