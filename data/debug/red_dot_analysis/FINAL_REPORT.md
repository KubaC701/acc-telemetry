# Red Dot Position Detection - Root Cause Analysis & Fix Recommendations

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Issue:** 1-pixel Y-coordinate detection error causes 1.72% lap position error at lap start
**Impact:** Lap comparison graphs show incorrect start/finish positions across laps

---

## Executive Summary

A **1-pixel difference** in red dot Y-coordinate detection (Y=27 vs Y=26) causes the position tracker to match **different track_path indices** (index 25 vs index 15), resulting in a **1.72% position error** (3.871% vs 2.151%) when all laps should start at 0.000%.

**Root Cause:** Track path indices 15 and 25 are only **2 pixels apart in Y-coordinate** (Y=25 vs Y=27). The current closest-point matching algorithm uses pure Euclidean distance without considering temporal consistency, allowing single-pixel detection noise to flip between two nearby track points.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Red Dot Detection Variance

| Frame | Lap | Red Dot (x,y) | Closest Index | Distance | Position % | Error from Expected |
|-------|-----|---------------|---------------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| 3064  | 1   | (15, 27)      | 25            | 1.00px   | 3.871%     | +3.871%             |
| 9430  | 3   | (15, 26)      | 15            | 1.41px   | 2.151%     | +2.151%             |
| 12431 | 4   | (15, 27)      | 25            | 1.00px   | 3.871%     | +3.871%             |

**Expected:** All laps should show 0.000% at lap start (first frame after lap transition).

**Observed:** Laps 1 and 4 show 3.871%, while Lap 3 shows 2.151% - a 1.72% inconsistency.

### 2. Track Path Geometry Analysis

**Critical Discovery:** The track path near the start/finish line has **two clusters** of points that are extremely close together:

- **Index 15:** Position (14, 25) - Arc length 16.7px from index 0 → 2.151% position
- **Index 25:** Position (14, 27) - Arc length 30.0px from index 0 → 3.871% position

These indices are only **2 pixels apart vertically** (Y=25 vs Y=27), but represent **13.3 pixels of arc length** (30.0 - 16.7 = 13.3px) along the racing line.

**Distance Matrix:**

```
Red Dot Position    Distance to Index 15    Distance to Index 25    Winner
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lap 1/4: (15, 27)   2.24px                  1.00px                  Index 25 ✓
Lap 3:   (15, 26)   1.41px                  1.41px                  Index 15 ✓ (tie-break)
```

**Key Insight:** When the red dot is at Y=26 (Lap 3), it is **equidistant** (1.41px) from both indices 15 and 25. The algorithm picks index 15 (lower index wins tie), but this is **incorrect** - the car is actually at the same physical location as laps 1/4.

### 3. Why Sub-Pixel Variation Occurs

The red dot centroid calculation is **sub-pixel accurate** (using OpenCV moments), but the final coordinates are rounded to integers. This means:

- Same physical car position can yield Y=26 or Y=27 depending on:
  - Frame compression artifacts
  - Anti-aliasing of red dot edges
  - Brightness variations (affects HSV thresholding)
  - Red dot pixel count (51-85 pixels across frames)

**Evidence from diagnostic data:**
- Frame 3064: 67.0px² red dot area, HSV V=85.1%, Y=27
- Frame 9430: 51.5px² red dot area, HSV V=80.0%, Y=26 ← Smaller, darker
- Frame 12431: 61.0px² red dot area, HSV V=85.9%, Y=27

The 23% variation in dot area (51.5 vs 67.0) suggests **lighting/compression differences** affecting detection.

---

## Root Cause: Algorithm Deficiency

The current implementation in `src/position_tracker_v2.py::calculate_position()` (lines 316-413) uses:

```python
# Find closest point on racing line to red dot (lines 344-356)
min_distance = float('inf')
closest_idx = 0

for i, (px, py) in enumerate(self.track_path):
    dx = dot_x - px
    dy = dot_y - py
    distance = dx*dx + dy*dy  # Squared distance

    if distance < min_distance:
        min_distance = distance
        closest_idx = i
```

**Problem:** This greedy nearest-neighbor search has **no tolerance for detection noise** and **no temporal consistency check**.

When the dot is near-equidistant from multiple track points (e.g., 1.41px vs 1.41px), the choice becomes arbitrary, leading to:
- **Spatial aliasing:** 1px detection shift → 10-index jump → 1.72% position error
- **Temporal discontinuity:** Position should progress smoothly, but can jump when tie-breaking

---

## Recommended Fixes (Ranked by Effectiveness)

### **FIX #1: Use Tolerance-Based Candidate Search (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**

Replace single closest-point matching with a **candidate pool + temporal consistency check**.

**Implementation:**

```python
def calculate_position_robust(self, dot_x: int, dot_y: int) -> float:
    """
    Calculate position using tolerance-based matching with temporal consistency.

    Algorithm:
    1. Find ALL track points within tolerance radius (e.g., 3.0 pixels)
    2. Among candidates, pick the one closest to EXPECTED position based on velocity
    3. If no candidates within tolerance, fall back to closest point (but flag as suspicious)
    """
    if not self.path_extracted or not self.track_path:
        return 0.0

    TOLERANCE_RADIUS = 3.0  # pixels - should cover typical detection noise

    # Step 1: Find all candidate points within tolerance
    candidates = []
    for i, (px, py) in enumerate(self.track_path):
        dx = dot_x - px
        dy = dot_y - py
        distance = np.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)

        if distance <= TOLERANCE_RADIUS:
            candidates.append((i, distance))

    if not candidates:
        # No points within tolerance - use closest point but log warning
        # (Keep existing fallback logic)
        print(f"⚠️  Warning: No track points within {TOLERANCE_RADIUS}px of dot ({dot_x}, {dot_y})")
        # ... existing closest-point code ...
        return position

    # Step 2: Among candidates, pick the one closest to EXPECTED position
    # Expected position = last_position + estimated_velocity * dt

    # Calculate expected index based on last known position
    expected_arc_length = (self.last_position / 100.0) * self.total_track_length
    expected_idx = self._arc_length_to_index(expected_arc_length)

    # Find candidate with smallest index deviation from expected
    best_candidate = min(candidates, key=lambda c: abs(c[0] - expected_idx))
    closest_idx = best_candidate[0]

    # If at lap start (last_position very low), prefer indices near start_idx
    if self.last_position < 5.0:
        best_candidate = min(candidates, key=lambda c: abs(c[0] - self.start_idx))
        closest_idx = best_candidate[0]

    # ... rest of position calculation using closest_idx ...
```

**Benefits:**
- **Tolerates detection noise:** ±1px shifts won't change matched index unless they cross tolerance boundary
- **Temporal consistency:** Prefers indices near expected position based on car velocity
- **Lap start robustness:** Special handling for first few frames after lap reset

**Expected Impact:** Reduces position error from 1.72% to <0.2% at lap start.

---

### **FIX #2: Lock Red Dot Pixel Position on First Lap (ALREADY PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)**

The code in `extract_position()` (lines 443-496) attempts to lock the start position on lap 1, but there's a subtle bug:

**Current behavior:**
- Line 218: Sets `self.start_position = track_path[0]` during path extraction
- Lines 463-484: On first lap, detects red dot and updates `self.start_position` to actual dot pixel

**Problem:** The start position is set to `track_path[0]` initially, but then **overwritten** with the detected red dot position on lap 1. This is correct. However, the position calculation still searches for the closest track_path index, which can vary by 1-2 pixels from the locked start position.

**Fix:** When at lap start (first frame after reset), **skip the closest-point search entirely** and force position to 0.0%:

```python
def extract_position(self, map_roi: np.ndarray) -> float:
    # ... existing dot detection code ...

    if self.lap_just_started:
        if not self.start_position_locked:
            # LAP 1: Lock start position
            self.start_position = (dot_x, dot_y)
            # ... existing caching code ...
            self.lap_just_started = False
            self.last_position = 0.0
            return 0.0  # ✓ Correct
        else:
            # LAP 2+: Force position to 0.0% for first frame
            print(f"      🏁 Lap reset - forcing position to 0.0%")
            self.lap_just_started = False
            self.last_position = 0.0
            return 0.0  # ← ADD THIS: Don't calculate, just return 0.0

    # ... rest of position calculation ...
```

**Benefits:**
- Guarantees all laps start at exactly 0.000%
- Eliminates the 2-4% offset entirely at lap start
- Simple, low-risk change

**Expected Impact:** Lap start position error → 0.000% (by definition)

---

### **FIX #3: Add Position Sanity Check at Lap Start**

Add a validation check: if we just reset the lap and calculated position is >5%, **reject it** and search for a better match near the start line.

```python
def extract_position(self, map_roi: np.ndarray) -> float:
    # ... existing code ...

    raw_position = self.calculate_position(dot_x, dot_y)

    # SANITY CHECK: At lap start, position should be near 0%
    # If it's >5%, the matched index is likely wrong
    if self.last_position < 2.0 and raw_position > 5.0:
        print(f"⚠️  Warning: Lap start position is {raw_position:.1f}% (expected <5%)")
        print(f"   Searching for better match near start line...")

        # Find the closest track point to START_POSITION instead of current dot
        best_idx = self.start_idx
        min_dist = float('inf')

        # Search within ±50 indices of start_idx
        for offset in range(-50, 51):
            idx = (self.start_idx + offset) % len(self.track_path)
            px, py = self.track_path[idx]
            dx = dot_x - px
            dy = dot_y - py
            dist = dx*dx + dy*dy

            if dist < min_dist:
                min_dist = dist
                best_idx = idx

        # Recalculate position using corrected index
        raw_position = self._calculate_position_from_index(best_idx)
        print(f"   Corrected to index {best_idx} → position {raw_position:.3f}%")

    return self._validate_position(raw_position)
```

**Benefits:**
- Catches egregious errors (3-4% at lap start is clearly wrong)
- Self-correcting without manual intervention
- Doesn't affect normal operation (only triggers at lap start)

**Expected Impact:** Reduces worst-case lap start error from 3.9% to <1%

---

### **FIX #4: Resample Track Path for Uniform Spacing**

The track path from `cv2.findContours()` has **non-uniform point spacing**. Near tight corners, points are close together; on straights, they're farther apart.

**Current spacing near start line:**
- Index 0→1: 1.41px
- Index 14→15: ~1px
- Index 15→16: 1.41px
- Index 24→25: 1.41px
- Index 25→26: 1.00px

**Problem:** Uneven spacing makes some regions more sensitive to detection noise.

**Fix:** Resample track path to have **uniform arc length spacing** (e.g., 1.5px per segment):

```python
def resample_track_path_uniform(self, target_spacing: float = 1.5) -> None:
    """
    Resample track path to have uniform arc length spacing.

    Args:
        target_spacing: Desired spacing between consecutive points (pixels)
    """
    if not self.track_path:
        return

    # Calculate cumulative arc lengths
    cumulative_lengths = [0.0]
    for i in range(len(self.track_path) - 1):
        p1 = self.track_path[i]
        p2 = self.track_path[i + 1]
        dx = p2[0] - p1[0]
        dy = p2[1] - p1[1]
        cumulative_lengths.append(cumulative_lengths[-1] + np.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy))

    # Add closing segment
    p1 = self.track_path[-1]
    p2 = self.track_path[0]
    dx = p2[0] - p1[0]
    dy = p2[1] - p1[1]
    total_length = cumulative_lengths[-1] + np.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)

    # Determine number of resampled points
    num_points = int(total_length / target_spacing)

    # Resample at uniform intervals
    resampled_path = []
    for i in range(num_points):
        target_length = i * target_spacing

        # Find bracketing points in original path
        idx = np.searchsorted(cumulative_lengths, target_length)
        if idx == 0:
            resampled_path.append(self.track_path[0])
        elif idx >= len(self.track_path):
            resampled_path.append(self.track_path[-1])
        else:
            # Interpolate between track_path[idx-1] and track_path[idx]
            p1 = self.track_path[idx - 1]
            p2 = self.track_path[idx]
            t = (target_length - cumulative_lengths[idx-1]) / (cumulative_lengths[idx] - cumulative_lengths[idx-1])

            x = int(p1[0] + t * (p2[0] - p1[0]))
            y = int(p1[1] + t * (p2[1] - p1[1]))
            resampled_path.append((x, y))

    self.track_path = resampled_path
    self.total_path_pixels = len(resampled_path)
    print(f"   Resampled track path: {num_points} points (uniform {target_spacing}px spacing)")
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates spatial aliasing caused by uneven point density
- Makes position calculation more robust to local geometry
- Easier to reason about position accuracy

**Expected Impact:** Reduces sensitivity to detection noise by 30-50%

## Implementation Priority

**IMMEDIATE (Required for Fix):**
1. **FIX #2** - Force position to 0.0% on lap reset (5 lines of code, zero risk)
2. **FIX #1** - Tolerance-based candidate search (30 lines, moderate risk)

**FOLLOW-UP (Nice to Have):**
3. **FIX #3** - Sanity check at lap start (20 lines, low risk)
4. **FIX #4** - Uniform resampling (50 lines, medium risk, benefits all tracking)

---

## Validation Test Plan

After implementing fixes:

### Test 1: Lap Start Consistency
**Objective:** All laps should start at 0.000% ± 0.1%

**Procedure:**
1. Extract position for frames 3064 (Lap 1), 9430 (Lap 3), 12431 (Lap 4)
2. Verify all show position ≤ 0.5%
3. Verify variance across laps < 0.1%

**Success Criteria:**
- Max position at lap start: 0.5%
- Lap-to-lap variance: <0.1%

### Test 2: Detection Noise Robustness
**Objective:** ±1px red dot shift should not cause >0.5% position change

**Procedure:**
1. Take frame 3064, detect red dot at (15, 27)
2. Manually shift to (15, 26), (15, 28), (14, 27), (16, 27)
3. Calculate position for each shifted dot
4. Verify position change <0.5% for all shifts

**Success Criteria:**
- Position variance for ±1px shift: <0.5%

### Test 3: Arc Length Verification
**Objective:** Verify indices 15 and 25 are correctly mapped

**Procedure:**
1. Calculate arc length from index 0 to indices 15 and 25
2. Verify index 15 = 2.15% (16.7px / 774.2px)
3. Verify index 25 = 3.87% (30.0px / 774.2px)
4. Verify difference = 1.72% (matches observed error)

**Success Criteria:**
- Arc length calculations match expected values ± 0.1%

### Test 4: Full Lap Progression
**Objective:** Position should progress smoothly from 0% → 100%

**Procedure:**
1. Process full lap (e.g., Lap 1 frames 3064-9429)
2. Plot position vs frame number
3. Verify monotonic increase (no backward jumps >1%)
4. Verify final position reaches 95-100%

**Success Criteria:**
- No backward jumps >1%
- Final position ≥ 95%

---

## Prevention Strategies

To avoid similar issues in the future:

### 1. Unit Tests for Position Calculation
Create unit tests with synthetic track paths and known positions:

```python
def test_position_calculation_robustness():
    """Test that ±1px detection noise doesn't cause large position errors."""
    tracker = PositionTrackerV2()

    # Create simple circular track path
    tracker.track_path = create_circular_path(radius=50, num_points=100)
    tracker.total_track_length = 2 * np.pi * 50
    tracker.start_idx = 0

    # Test position at various points
    test_cases = [
        ((50, 0), 0.0),     # Start (top of circle)
        ((0, 50), 25.0),    # Quarter way
        ((50, 100), 50.0),  # Halfway
        ((-50, 50), 75.0),  # Three-quarters
    ]

    for (dot_x, dot_y), expected_position in test_cases:
        # Test with exact position
        pos = tracker.calculate_position(dot_x, dot_y)
        assert abs(pos - expected_position) < 1.0, f"Expected {expected_position}%, got {pos}%"

        # Test with ±1px noise
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            noisy_pos = tracker.calculate_position(dot_x + dx, dot_y + dy)
            error = abs(noisy_pos - expected_position)
            assert error < 0.5, f"±1px noise caused {error}% error (expected <0.5%)"
```

### 2. Diagnostic Logging
Add logging to track position calculation decisions:

```python
def calculate_position(self, dot_x: int, dot_y: int) -> float:
    # ... calculation code ...

    if ENABLE_DIAGNOSTICS:
        print(f"[POS] Dot=({dot_x}, {dot_y}) → Index={closest_idx} → Pos={position:.3f}%")
        print(f"      Distance={min_distance:.2f}px, ArcLen={arc_length:.1f}px")

    return position
```

### 3. Visualization Overlays
During development, save debug frames showing:
- Detected red dot position (crosshair)
- Matched track_path index (circle)
- Distance between dot and matched point (line)
- Current position percentage (text)

This would have caught the index 15 vs 25 issue immediately.

---

## Conclusion

The 1-pixel red dot detection variance is not the true problem - it's a symptom of the **greedy nearest-neighbor algorithm's fragility** when track points are densely clustered.

**The fix is not to improve red dot detection accuracy** (which is already sub-pixel), but to **make the position calculation algorithm robust to sub-pixel noise** through:
1. Forcing lap start to 0.0% (eliminates problem at source)
2. Tolerance-based candidate search (prevents index flipping)
3. Temporal consistency checks (validates results make physical sense)

**Implementation effort:** ~2 hours
**Risk level:** Low (changes are localized to position calculation)
**Expected improvement:** Lap start position error: 3.9% → 0.0% ✓

## Appendix: Supporting Data

### A. Track Path Indices Near Start Line

| Index | Position (x, y) | Distance from Index 0 | Arc Length (px) | Position (%) |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| 0     | (19, 11)        | 0.00                 | 0.0             | 0.000%       |
| 15    | (14, 25)        | 16.16                | 16.7            | 2.151%       |
| 25    | (14, 27)        | 18.44                | 30.0            | 3.871%       |

**Observation:** Indices 15 and 25 are spatially close (2px apart) but represent different arc lengths along the curving path.

### B. Red Dot Detection Statistics

| Frame | Lap | Area (px²) | HSV H | HSV S | HSV V | Centroid (x, y) |
|-------|-----|------------|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 3064  | 1   | 67.0       | 0°    | 100%  | 85.1% | (15, 27)        |
| 9430  | 3   | 51.5       | 178°  | 100%  | 80.0% | (15, 26)        |
| 12431 | 4   | 61.0       | 179°  | 100%  | 85.9% | (15, 27)        |

**Observation:** 23% variation in red dot area (51.5 vs 67.0 px²) and 5% variation in brightness (V=80% vs 85%) suggests frame-to-frame compression/lighting differences affecting detection.
