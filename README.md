# ACC Telemetry Extractor (Console Edition)

Extract detailed telemetry data from Assetto Corsa Competizione gameplay videos using computer vision. Designed for **console players (PS5/Xbox)** who can't access native telemetry export.

## 🎯 What It Does

This tool analyzes ACC gameplay videos frame-by-frame to extract:
- **Throttle input** (0-100%)
- **Brake input** (0-100%)
- **Steering input** (-1.0 to +1.0)

And generates:
- CSV data files for analysis
- High-resolution graphs with multiple detail levels
- Braking zone analysis
- Throttle application analysis
- Lap statistics

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Set up Python environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Place your gameplay video as input_video.mp4

# 3. Extract telemetry
python main.py

# 4. Generate detailed analysis
python generate_detailed_analysis.py
```

## 📊 Output Examples

The tool generates **4 types of detailed visualizations** (all at 300 DPI for zooming):

### 1. Comprehensive Overview
6-panel layout with:
- Complete lap overview
- Throttle detail with reference lines
- Brake detail with statistics
- Steering detail (color-coded)
- Pedal overlay (shows when both pedals are pressed)
- Complete lap statistics

![Example Overview](docs/example_overview.png)

### 2. Zoomed Sections
Your lap divided into sections (default: 6) for detailed analysis of specific areas.

### 3. Braking Zones Analysis
Every braking event isolated with:
- Context before/after
- Duration, max brake, average brake
- Steering overlay to see trail braking

### 4. Throttle Application Analysis
3-panel analysis showing:
- Throttle with color gradient (rate of change)
- Throttle vs steering correlation
- Throttle application rate (smoothness)

## 🎮 Supported Setup

Currently configured for:
- **Game**: Assetto Corsa Competizione (Console)
- **Resolution**: 1280×720 (720p)
- **HUD**: Default ACC HUD with visible throttle/brake bars

**Other resolutions?** You'll need to recalibrate ROI coordinates using the helper scripts (see docs).

## 🔧 Calibration Helper Scripts

If your video resolution differs:
- `find_throttle_brake_bars.py` - Find ROI coordinates for your resolution
- `visualize_rois.py` - Verify ROI placement
- `debug_braking.py` - Debug brake detection issues

## 📖 Documentation

- **[DETAILED_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md](DETAILED_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md)** - Complete guide to using the detailed visualizations
- **[PROJECT_SUMMARY.md](docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)** - Technical deep dive

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **OpenCV** - Video processing and computer vision
- **NumPy** - Array operations
- **Pandas** - Data handling and CSV export
- **Matplotlib** - Visualization
- **PyYAML** - Configuration

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Video Processing**: Extract frames from gameplay video
2. **ROI Extraction**: Crop specific regions (throttle bar, brake bar, steering indicator)
3. **Color Detection**: Use HSV color space to detect:
   - Green/yellow pixels (throttle - changes with TC activation)
   - Red/orange pixels (brake - changes with ABS activation)
   - White pixels (steering indicator dot)
4. **Measurement**: Calculate percentage of bar filled or position of indicator
5. **Export**: Generate CSV data and high-resolution visualizations

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Personal Improvement
- Compare your laps to find where you're losing time
- Analyze braking points consistency
- Study throttle application technique
- Identify problem corners

### Lap Comparison
- Record multiple laps and compare side-by-side
- Track improvement over practice sessions
- Find which corners have the most variation

### Learn from Others
- Download fast laps from YouTube
- Extract their telemetry
- Compare your technique to theirs
- Identify specific differences in inputs

## 🔬 Key Features

### Multi-Color Detection
- Handles TC/ABS activation color changes
- Throttle: Green → Yellow when TC active
- Brake: Red → Orange when ABS active

### High-Resolution Output
- 300 DPI graphs for detailed analysis
- Suitable for printing and annotation
- Frame-by-frame accuracy

### Comprehensive Statistics
- Lap duration and frame count
- Average and max values for all inputs
- Full throttle percentage and time
- Braking event count and duration
- Steering angle statistics

### Intelligent Analysis
- Automatic braking zone detection
- Context frames before/after events
- Trail braking identification
- Throttle smoothness analysis
- Pedal overlap detection (both pedals pressed)

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Resolution-dependent**: ROI coordinates need recalibration for different video resolutions
2. **HUD-dependent**: Requires default ACC HUD to be visible
3. **Console-focused**: Designed for console gameplay footage (PC players have native telemetry export)
4. **Post-processing only**: Not real-time (but console players record first, analyze later anyway)

## 🚧 Roadmap

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Planned)
- [ ] Automatic ROI detection (no manual calibration needed)
- [ ] Lap time extraction using OCR
- [ ] Gear detection

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Built by a console sim racer frustrated by the lack of telemetry tools. Inspired by professional telemetry software like MoTeC i2 and RaceStudio, but adapted for the constraint of console gaming: **if you can see it on screen, we can extract it**.
